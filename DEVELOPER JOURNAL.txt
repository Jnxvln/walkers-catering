BIG TO-DOs:
  Event data on public Events view don't match those of the Home view

Changed auth from JSON Web Token to PassportJS. Mostly works, but when logged out and go to /clubhouse, briefly displays the
clubhouse page before redirecting to login screen. NOT GOOD. Tried many fixes, I've gotten nothing to work so far.

I've added the Events pages and views.
Large issue to be handled: Token expires in 3600 (1hr) but doesn't yet refresh. The UI doesn't notify the user, things just break and it can be difficult to determine the error messages in the console, sometimes. It makes you think something else is wrong. However, once you log out and log back in, all is well and everything works.

Need to handle not only token refresh, but UI messages or toasts to inform the user in case the token doesn't refresh for some reason

Also, events data on the home view don't match that of the Events public page. (No image src, location, etc.)
These will need to match. The home view should basically just show the textual properties and lead the user to the actual public Events page where the image and all the other details are present

I've finished the news pages and views (for now).
Next I will duplicate these for the Events pages and views.

Started this journal to keep myself up-to-date on what needs to be done or fixed so I don't lose track of where I am
